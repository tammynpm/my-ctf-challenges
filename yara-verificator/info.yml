Subject: Urgent! Malware Remediation Required

Team,

Our IDS flagged multple hosts beaconing to an external IP. All infected Windows machines are using the same User-Agent string: Mozilla/5.0 like Gecko.

I've dumped all executables from the affected systems. Write a YARA rule to find the malware so we can clean the rest of the network.

- Manger
